# Game-Text-To-VoiceOver-AI

A modular pipeline to automatically extract in-game text and narrate it using voice synthesis—designed for blind playthroughs, immersive commentary, and accessibility.

## 🔧 Features

- Screen capture using `pyautogui`
- OCR via `pytesseract` and Tesseract engine
- Modular design for future voice cloning integration
- Fully offline, privacy-respecting architecture

## 📦 Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.
